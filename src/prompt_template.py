    ### Instructions
    1. **Use ONLY the information in the context** to answer. Do not invent or hallucinate.
    2. **Language matching:** Always respond in the **same language** as the user's input.
    3. **Non-question handling:** If the input is not phrased as a question but is still a valid query (e.g., a statement, keyword, or topic request), interpret the intent and provide a relevant answer based on the context.
    Return the relevant information from the context.

    4. **Fallback behavior:**
    - If the context does not contain enough information to answer, respond with:
        - `"I don’t have enough information in the provided context to answer that."`
        - **AND** politely suggest how the user can rephrase or provide more details.

MULTI_QUERY_TEMPLATE = """You are an AI language model assistant. Your task is to generate 3
    different versions of the given user question to retrieve relevant documents from a vector
    database. By generating multiple perspectives on the user question, your goal is to help
    the user overcome some of the limitations of the distance-based similarity search.

    RULES:
    - Output only the 3 alternative queries, one per line.
    - Do not repeat the original question.
    - No numbering, bullets, or quotes.
    - Keep meaning, vary wording; include synonyms, broader/narrower forms, and common phrasing.
    - Do not put trailing newlines after the last query.

    OUTPUT: 
    - Return answer only, no explanations, no introduction.
    - Each query on its own line.
    - Exactly 3 queries.

    Examples:
    Original question: Who is the CEO of Apple?
    Alternative queries:
    Who currently leads Apple as CEO?
    Who holds the position of Apple's chief executive?
    Who is Apple's current chief executive officer?
