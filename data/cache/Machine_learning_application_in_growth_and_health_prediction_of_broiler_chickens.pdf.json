There is a growing demand for the development and use of smart devices at the farm level, which would generate enough data, which increases the potential for AI using machine learning algorithms and real-time analysis. Machine learning (ML) is a category of algorithm that allows software to become accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed. The essential principle of machine learning is to construct algorithms that can receive input data and use statistical analysis to predict an output. Exploitation of machine learning approaches, by using different training inputs, derived the prediction accuracy of growth and body weight in broiler chickens that ranged from 98 to 99%. Furthermore, a neural network with an accuracy of 100% identi /uniFB01 ed the presence or absence of ascites in broiler chickens, while the support vector machine (SVM) model obtained an accuracy rate of 99.5% in combination with machine vision for the recognition of healthy and bird /uniFB02 u-challenged chickens. Consequently, machine learning algorithms, besides accurate growth prediction of broiler chickens, can successfully contribute to health disorders prediction. It is obvious that machine learning has a great potential for application in the future. This paper analyses machine learning applications in broiler growth and health prediction, and its ability to cope with high inputs of data and non-linearity can successfully replace common methodology.\n\nKeywords:\n\nmachine learning; broiler; growth; health\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe informatics revolution offered solutions in many areas of agricultural production worldwide.

As new opportunities arise a part of the research can essentially be done by machine learning. Machine learning is de /uniFB01 ned as the /uniFB01 eld of science that promotes machines ' ability to learn without exact programming through learning past behaviours and rules from old data (Cihan, 2017). Machine learning is already part of many scienti /uniFB01 c interests, such as medicine (Kang et al. , 2015; Zhang et al. , 2017; Maksimovi ć et al. , 2016), meteorology (Cramer et al. , 2017; Rhee and Im, 2017; Aybar et al. , 2016), economics (Barboza et al. , 2017; Zhao et al. , 2017; Jovi ć et al. , 2016; Maksimovi ć et al. , 2017) and aquaculture (López et al. , 2017; Zhou et al. , 2018). This review aims to introduce machine learning methods used in poultry management systems, and to underline potential improvements in broiler productivity, health and welfare.\n\n## An overview on machine learning\n\nMachine learning process can be explained as a computer code where a performance standard is optimised using past data or knowledge. Model needs to be de /uniFB01 ned with some variables and, through providing data, a computer program is trained to optimise the parameters of the model which could be designed to predict or to describe. Figure 1 contains the machine learning pipeline.\n\nFigure 1 General pipeline of machine learning.\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nMachine learning, depending on the learning type, can be supervised and unsupervised, with many learning models ( Table 1 ) and learning algorithms ( Table 2 ), which are validated by different statistical measures ( Table 3 ).\n\nVapnik (1995) was /uniFB01 rst to describe support vector machines (SVMs) as a binary classi /uniFB01 er that creates a linear separating hyper-plane to classify data instances. This model has been used for classi /uniFB01 cation, regression, and clustering, which were the most frequently used algorithms that support vector regression (Smola, 1996), and least squares that support the vector machine (Suykens et al. , 2002). Arti /uniFB01 cial neural networks are supervised models that are used for regression and classi /uniFB01 cation problems, where the radial basis function networks, back-propagation, perceptron algorithms, and resilient back-propagation, are mostly present in the literature. Deep learning (DL) or deep neural networks belong to arti /uniFB01 cial neural networks, but contains several hidden layers between the input and output layers. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is typical representative of deep learning (Goodfellow et al. , 2016), together with deep Boltzmann machines and deep belief networks (Salakhutdinov, 2009).\n\nTable 1 Machine learning models.\n\n## Model\n\nSupport vector machines (SVMs)\n\nDeep learning (DL)\n\nDimensionality reduction (DR)\n\nDecision trees (DT)\n\nArti /uniFB01 cial neural networks (ANN)\n\nEnsemble learning (EL)\n\nInstance based models (IBM)\n\nBayesian models (BM)\n\n## Table 2 Machine learning algorithms.\n\n## Model\n\nAdaptive-neuro fuzzy inference systems (ANFIS)\n\nBayesian belief network (BBN)\n\nBootstrap aggregating (Bagging)\n\nBayesian network (BN)\n\nBack-propagation network (BPN)\n\nClassi /uniFB01 cation and regression trees (CART)\n\nConvolutional neural networks (cnns)\n\nDeep boltzmann machine (DBM)\n\nDeep belief network (DBN)\n\nDeep neural networks (DNN)\n\nExtreme learning machines (elms)\n\nEnsemble neural networks (enns)\n\nGeneralized regression neural network (GRNN)\n\nK-nearest neighbour (KNN)\n\nLeast squares-support vector machine (LS-SVM)\n\nMultivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS)\n\nMulti-layer perceptron (MLP)\n\nMultiple linear regression (MLR)\n\nOrdinary least squares regression (OLSR)\n\nPrincipal component analysis (PCA)\n\nPartial least squares regression (PLSR)\n\nRadial basis function networks (RBFN)\n\nRandom forest (RF)\n\nSupervised kohonen networks (skns)\n\nSelf-organising maps (soms)\n\nGroup method of data handling (GMDH)\n\nSupport vector regression (SVR)\n\n## Table 3 Statistical measures for the validation of machine learning algorithms.\n\n## Model\n\nCoef /uniFB01 cient of determination (R2)\n\nRoot mean squared error (RMSE)\n\nRoot mean square error of prediction (RMSEP)\n\nAverage relative root mean square error (RRMSE)\n\nMean absolute error (MAE)\n\nMean absolute percentage error (MAPE)\n\nMean percentage error (MPE)\n\nMachine learning broiler: B. Milosevic et al.\n\nRegression aims to provide the prediction of an output variable according to known input variables. Present algorithms include linear regression and logistic regression, as well as stepwise regression. More complex regression algorithms have been developed, such as ordinary least squares regression, multivariate adaptive regression splines and multiple linear regression. (Friedman, 1991; Quinlan, 1992; Craven and Islam, 2011).\n\nDecision trees are the primary learner in ensemble models, at /uniFB01 rst random forest (Breiman, 2001), with additional boosting and bagging implementations, such as boosting technique (Schapire, 1999) and bootstrap aggregating or bagging algorithms are used (Breiman, 1996). Bayesian inference is used for solving either classi /uniFB01 cation or regression problems and is a base for probabilistic graphical models under the Bayesian model (Pearl, 1988).\n\n## Broiler growth and machine learning\n\nGrowth of any living being is a complex, nonlinear dynamic and is not easy to model. Commonly used system identi /uniFB01 cation approaches use linear model structures, which are not able to deal with the nonlinearity present during the entire growth process of broilers. A promising alternative is the soft computing approach and machine learning models and algorithms with the ability to approximate nonlinear functions (Johansen et al. , 2017). Poultry growth is usually modelled using the Gompertz model, using average body weight data over a period of time for a given breed under speci /uniFB01 c farm management conditions. Regularly implemented selection and genetic changes, nutritional factors and environmental concerns, however, make such models limited in their effectiveness because of the dif /uniFB01 culty of /uniFB01 tting the growth curve across time, bird strains and other variables. Furthermore, generating data for every strain of birds under continually changing variables is dif /uniFB01 cult, time consuming, and expensive (Ahmad, 2009).\n\nNeural networks offer an alternative to regression analysis for biological growth modelling, which have been experimentally con /uniFB01 rmed (Roush et al. , 2006). This research included twenty/uniFB01 ve male chicks (Ross × Ross 308) raised in an environmental chamber. Body weights were determined daily and feed and water were provided ad libitum . Average body weights of 18 birds were used as the data points for the growth curve to be modelled. Comparison was made between the modelling by the Gompertz nonlinear regression equation and neural network modelling. Accuracy of the models was determined by mean square error (MSE), mean absolute deviation (MAD), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and bias, which showed that the Gompertz equation underestimated the values whereas the neural networks produced little or no overestimation of the observed body weight responses Dynamic control of the growth of broiler chickens has potential bene /uniFB01 ts for farmers in terms of improved production effectiveness, as well as for animal welfare, e.g. in terms of improved leg health.\n\nDemmers et al. (2010) introduced a differential recurrent neural network (DRNN) identi /uniFB01 ed from experimental data to represent broiler chicken growth using a nonlinear system identi /uniFB01 cation algorithm. The DRNN model was used as the internal model for nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to achieve a group of desired growth curves. The experimental results demonstrated that the DRNN explained dynamics of the broiler growth process convincingly well. The DRNN based NMPC was able to specify feed intakes in real time so that the broiler weights accurately followed the desired growth curves ranging from -12% to +12% of the standard curve. The overall mean relative error between the desired and achieved broiler weight was 1.8% for the period from day 12 to day 51. Similarly Demmers et al.\n\n(2018) identi /uniFB01 ed a differential recurrent neural network (DRNN) from experimental data to represent animal growth using a nonlinear system identi /uniFB01 cation algorithm. The DRNN model was then used as the internal model for nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to achieve a group of desired growth curves. The experimental results demonstrated that the DRNN model captured the underlying dynamics of the broiler and pig growth process reasonably well. The DRNN based model was able to specify feed intakes in real time, so that the weights accurately followed the desired growth curves ranging from -12% to +12% and -20% to +20% of the standard curve for broiler chickens and pigs, respectively. The overall mean relative error between the desired and achieved broiler or pig weight was 1.8% for the period from day 12 to day 51 and 10.5% for the period from week /uniFB01 ve to week 21, respectively.\n\nAnother study by Johansen et al. (2017) investigated neural network forecasting models trained on farm-scale broiler batch production data from 12 batches from the same house. The model forecasted future broiler weight and used environmental conditions such as heating, ventilation, and temperature along with behaviour, such as feed and water consumption. Results indicated that the dynamic interconnection between environmental conditions and broiler growth could be captured by the model. Additionally, neural network model with a back-propagation algorithm successfully found the relationship between the inputs and outputs of feed intake, weight gain and feed conversion ratio variables (Ghazanfari, 2014). High coef /uniFB01 cient of determination (R 2 ) and T values for the ANN model in comparison to linear regression showed that the arti /uniFB01 cial neural network (ANN) was an ef /uniFB01 cient method for growth performance prediction in the starter period for broiler chickens.\n\nThree neural networks were used in the research conducted by Ahmad (2009), where actual growth data were used to predict broiler growth over the next 50 days. The BackPropagation-3 neural network gave the best /uniFB01 tting line, with predictions /uniFB01 tting closely to the actual data points. The R 2 was 0.998, which clearly supported machine learning models and algorithms for modelling broiler growth in the future and decision-making process at the farm level. This conclusion was supported by a study where 190 arti /uniFB01 cial intelligencebased models were developed and compared for predicting the body mass of chicks from 2 to 21 d of age subjected to different duration and intensities of thermal challenge (Ferraz et al. , 2014). The neural networks were most accurate in predicting the body mass of chicks from 2 to 21 d of age after they were subjected to the input variables, and showed an R 2 of 0.9993 and a standard error of 4.62 g. The used machine learning model in this study enabled the simulation of different scenarios by changing the level of different inputs, which can be embedded into the heating control systems.\n\nSimilar conclusions were given in another study (Moharrery et al. , 2007), where a three-layer feed forward arti /uniFB01 cial neural network was used to predict body weight, plasma hormones and liver enzymes in broiler chickens. Six diet parameters were selected (ME: metabolisable energy in the diet; CHO: carbohydrate, CP: crude protein; MCHO: metabolisable carbohydrate; OM: organic matter; gram intake during growing period) as inputs (predictor) and parameters for the output ( Figure 2 , Table 4 ). Birds were fed diets containing different concentration of energy and protein.\n\nFigure 2 Structure of proposed arti /uniFB01 cial neural network (Moharrery et al. , 2007)\n\n<!-- image -->\n\nThe network provided the simulation of the /uniFB01 nal results with the contribution percentage of each dietary component to the production trait under study. This method allowed the simulation of enzyme patterns in the liver, providing the contribution of plasma hormones from each diet to the broiler physiology variables under study. The network performance obtained in this study was very high (99%), which was acceptable.\n\nTable 4 Comparison of results for observed and ANNs predicted values (Moharrery et al. , 2007).\n\n| Parameter   | BW     | FI     | FE     | IVL    | MDH    | ICD    | AAT    | IGF    | GH     | T3     | T4     |\n|-------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Mean        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |        |\n| Observed    | 1009   | 1782   | 49.1   | 28.36  | 15.17  | 25.52  | 49.33  | 3.318  | 1.146  | 4.302  | 13.03  |\n| Predicted   | 1010   | 1783   | 49.1   | 28.37  | 15.13  | 25.29  | 49.13  | 3.311  | 1.046  | 4.301  | 13.05  |\n| P value 1   | 0.9972 | 0.9587 | 0.9382 | 0.9133 | 0.9719 | 0.9238 | 0.9161 | 0.8845 | 0.9969 | 0.9945 | 0.7926 |\n| Error, % 2  | 0.084  | 0.058  | -0.017 | 0.017  | -0.248 | -0.911 | -0.403 | -0.218 | 0.019  | -0.022 | -0.033 |\n| SD          | 1.095  | 0.261  | 1.450  | 1.220  | 1.328  | 3.777  | 4.334  | 2.082  | 0.284  | 0.711  | 2.425  |\n| Bias        | 1.005  | 1.005  | 0.9996 | 0.9989 | 0.9979 | 0.9880 | 0.9946 | 0.9981 | 1.000  | 0.9998 | 0.9993 |\n| Accuracy    | 1.0032 | 1.0007 | 1.0075 | 1.089  | 1.0057 | 1.0187 | 1.0146 | 1.0062 | 1.0023 | 1.0037 | 1.0071 |\n| MSE         | 0.947  | 4.705  | 0.698  | 0.344  | 0.203  | 0.980  | 2.124  | 0.064  | 0.003  | 0.030  | 0.314  |\n\nBW: body weight; FI: feed intake; FE: feed ef /uniFB01 ciency; IVL: in vitro lipogenesis; MDH: malate dehydrogenase; ICD: isocitrate dehydrogenase; AAT: aspartate aminotransferase; IGF: insulin-like growth factor-I; GH: growth hormone; T3: triiodothyronine; T4: thyroxine. 1 this value showed a statistically signi /uniFB01 cant difference between observed and predicted values. 2 error percentage = (((predicted -observed)/observed)*100).

This combination may replace manual weight measuring, which decreases animal's welfare and increases human involvement and labour costs. Speci /uniFB01 c combinations of the machine vision and arti /uniFB01 cial neural networks were used to estimate live body weight of broiler chickens reared for 42 days (Amraei et al. , 2016). Imaging was performed two times daily and strong correlations between the body weight and /uniFB01 ve physical extracted features were found. Different ANN techniques, including\n\nBayesian regulation, Levenberg -Marquardt, scaled conjugate gradient and gradient descent were used. Bayesian regulation with an R² value of 0.98 was the best for prediction of broiler weight. Wang et al. (2017) introduced a three-dimensional camera, which can measure phenotypic features in order to determine broiler weight. Their procedure of image pre-processing consists of image cropping, median /uniFB01 ltering, OTSU threshold segmentation and binarisation. During this process, nine features were extracted with a mathematical geometry method, including area, uniformity, width, length, radius, perimeter, volume, back width and age. These nine features were used to construct a back propagation neural network with body weight as an output. Based on these data, the body weight estimation model was established to realise the population weight estimations. The root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.048 kg, mean relative error (MRE) was 3.3%, optimal /uniFB01 tness was 0.994, minimum relative error was 0.5% and the maximum relative error was about 11%. These results showed that the proposed method was feasible and effective for constructing broiler weight estimation models, providing a theoretical basis for estimating broiler growth by using machine vision technology.\n\n## Broiler health and machine learning\n\nPoultry diseases are a major source of economic losses to farmers and pose a serious threat for the human population health. Consequently, monitoring and early warning of disease outbreaks are essential in poultry breeding. As previously elaborated, machine learning possesses the ability to cope with nonlinear connection between different variables, which makes its use in broiler health prediction possible. Kirby et al. (1997), tried to identify broilers with ascites using multiple linear regression and logistic regression. They found that a linear regression model was complex and did not show normally distributed errors, which increased chances of false predictions. On the other hand, a logistic regression model was found to be simple, biologically meaningful and statistically powerful.\n\nAscites is one of the main sources of economic problems in the broiler industry (Wideman, 1988; Wideman and Bottje, 1993). De /uniFB01 ning physiological factors that categorise broilers with a predisposition to ascites could be helpful in order to eliminate these individuals from the /uniFB02 ock. Arti /uniFB01 cial neural networks were found to effectively identify broilers with and without ascites (Roush et al. , 1996). The model was a three-layer back-propagation neural network with an input layer of 15 physiological variables with an output layer of two factors (the presence or absence of ascites). A comparison was made between laboratory diagnostic results and the neural network predicted ascites incidence, and the neural network accurately (100%) identi /uniFB01 ed the presence or absence of ascites in the training set. Furthermore, probabilistic neural networks based on non-invasive inputs showed acceptable results (Roush et al. , 1997). Inputs were oxygen concentration in the blood, body weight, electrocardiogram, haematocrit, S wave, and heart rate of individual birds. As in the previous study, output was presence or absence of ascites. The conclusion was that the use of models developed with arti /uniFB01 cial neural networks may enhance the diagnosis of ascites in broilers, and may help developing broiler strains without a propensity for ascites.\n\nIf thermal conditions inside a poultry house are beyond the comfort limits, the bird physiologically adapts to maintain normal temperature and focuses only on survival (Medeiros et al. , 2005), which leads to lower productivity. The best indicator of heat stress in broiler is their rectal temperature (Campos et al. , 2004; Spiers et al. , 2004). Hence, research was done with the objective of developing and evaluating arti /uniFB01 cial\n\nneural networks for the prediction of broilers ' rectal temperature in function of thermal conditions air temperature, relative humidity, and air velocity. The selected multilayer perceptron (MLP), achieved excellent results, providing estimates with an average error of 0.78% for the training set and 1.02% for the validation set (Lopes et al. , 2014).\n\nAnother technique that may have future applications is support vector machines (SVM), a type of machine learning algorithm, used by Hepworth et al. (2012), to identify risk factors for hock burn incidence, using recorded data relative to farm management conditions (stocking density, number and age of parent /uniFB02 ocks, sex, and rearing system) together with daily water consumption, average weekly weight, mortality, and slaughterhouse outcomes (rejections, downgrades, and hock burns). Results were compared to manually build logistic regression models in order to test SVM. Conclusions were that this technique had great potential to improve poultry health and welfare as it proved robust for a broad range of complex data sets.\n\nMachine vision and learning algorithm applications for broiler disease detection is an effective method to prevent large-scale outbreaks of disease (Zhuang et al. , 2018). In this study broilers infected with bird /uniFB02 u virus were placed in isolator cages for obtaining images and extracting features of healthy and sick chickens. These features were analysed by machine learning algorithms and the effect of each feature on the recognition accuracy was obtained. The SVM model obtained an accuracy rate of 99.469% for the test samples, which was superior to those of the other machine learning algorithms. The experimental results showed that the machine learning algorithms could effectively differentiate broilers from the image background, extract the posture information of broilers, and precisely and quickly identify the health status of broilers, which can be used for the smart identi /uniFB01 cation of broiler health status in the future.\n\n## Conclusions\n\nThis review analysed machine learning application in broiler industry, at particular its ' use in growth and health prediction. It was observed that recent developments in computer science have effectively addressed the problems in broiler industry. Some results are very promising and give an excellent basis for future research, especially in the /uniFB01 eld of growth modelling, disease detection, and /uniFB01 nally, animal welfare improvement.\n\n## References\n\n- AHMAD, H.A.
