The need to formulate a new national AI strategy for a new era of AI\n\n(1) The impact of social implementation of Large-scale Language Models (LLM) by ChatGPT\n\nA new era of artificial intelligence has begun.\n\nChatGPT, which was launched in November 2022 by OpenAI, Inc. in the U.S., has  had  a  major  impact  across  the  world.  Chat  services  using  artificial intelligence (AI) based on this Large Language Model (LLM) can now be used by anyone for free or at a low cost via smartphones and other devices. Suddenly, people  who  have  no  experience  with  programming  languages  can  instantly benefit  from  advanced AI,  as  naturally  (or  nearly)  as  if  they  were  talking  to another person.\n\nMembers  of  our  project  team  (PT)  commented  on  the  immense  societal impact the social implementation of large-scale language models will have:\n\n\"It's likely to affect nearly every white-collar job.' 1\n\n'We are in an era of unlimited content creation through the use of machines.' 2\n\n'An invention equivalent to the internal combustion engine, the semiconductor, and the Internet is happening before our eyes at an explosive rate.\" 3\n\nThe evolution of AI and its implementation in society, as typified by large-scale language models and other \"foundation models 4 ,\" could be a catalyst for new\n\n1 Yutaka Matsuo, Professor, University of Tokyo (2nd PT, February 17, 2023)\n\n2 Kazuto Ataka, Professor, Keio University SFC (2nd PT, February 17, 2023)\n\n3 Hiroaki Kitano, Director, Sony Computer Science Laboratories (5th PT, March 14, 2023)\n\n4 The term \"foundational model\" refers to a machine learning model, such as\n\neconomic growth.\n\nAlready  the  number  of  situations  in  which AI  is  used  in  our  daily  lives  and businesses is exploding. New ways of using AI are being \"discovered\" one after another,  ranging  from  correcting  and  summarizing  texts  to  suggesting  ideas, writing  scientific  papers,  programming,  and  generating  images.  Multimodal functions that can combine or associate multiple data types, such as images and sound, as well as text, are also emerging, further expanding their applications. In addition, since the release of APIs, which are third-party development tools linked to the underlying model, a large number of domestic and foreign companies have announced new products that incorporate large-scale language models into their services and products, and we can expect to see a large number of new startups in this field in the future.\n\nThe evolution of AI is expected to lead to rapid improvements in productivity, dramatic changes in the way people work, lower language barriers, and other fundamental  changes  in  the  assumptions  on  which  various  socioeconomic systems are designed.\n\nThe global changes that have taken place over the past few months indicate the arrival of an unexpected era, which can truly be called the \"New AI Era.' How should our country's economy and society respond to these changes? A new national strategy is required.\n\n## (2) Europe and the U.S. moving forward with rules for social acceptance\n\nPowerful AIs can bring greater social risks.\n\nIn  addition  to  the  problems  of  errors  and  biases  caused  by  data  and  other factors,  AIs  using  large-scale  language  models  have  the  risk  of  mixing  in \"plausible lies\" in which incorrect information is communicated in a format that is difficult to detect. The risk of abuse, such as the proliferation of sophisticated fake\n\nGPT or Bert, that can be pre-trained on a large set of general data and then fine-tuned through retraining to adapt to a wide range of tasks.\n\ninformation whose authenticity is difficult to discern, is also feared to increase due to technological advances in image generation, speech synthesis, etc. Concerns about  AI-based  privacy  violations,  cyber  attacks,  and  military  use  are  also becoming more serious.\n\nThese risks are growing daily as AI evolves and spreads, and in parallel with the promotion of AI development, regulatory discussions for social acceptance are accelerating in Western countries.\n\nIn the EU, for example, legislation has been drafted since around 2019 based on the basic principle of classifying AI risks into four categories (including human rights, health and safety) and adjusting the type of regulations according to the degree of risk. Since around the same time in the U.S., bipartisan discussions on legislation  have  been  conducted  with AI  human  rights  violations  and  national security risks in mind. In the process, the U.S. and EU began to work together and cooperate to create a legal system that is based on the same values and is easy  to  interoperate  with  each  other.  In  China,  several  specific  laws  and administrative regulations, such as the Network Safety Law and the Data Safety Law, are already in force and attempt to impose strict discipline on AI.\n\nIn Japan, however, the basic idea that it is important to have a non-regulatory and  non-binding  framework  for  AIs  was  presented  in  2019.  Since  then, discussions have been held in the direction that, to avoid stifling innovation, laws and regulations should not be imposed on the development and use of AI, and policy tools should be formulated jointly by the public and private sectors through soft  law.  However,  with  the  development  of  GPT  and  other  basic  models progressing ， and the social implementation of AI advancing at an unexpected speed, the assumptions underlying the policy discussions to date  now face a major challenge.\n\nWith the increasing utilization of AI across borders, the big divergence between international discussions on regulations and our policy may  likely lead to isolation of  the  Japanese AI  markets.  We  have  come  to  a  period  where  we  need  to reconsider the regulatory gap between their countries and us.\n\n## (3) New National Strategy for AI in the New AI Era\n\nMany have long voiced concern over Japan lagging behind in AI development and utilization. Japan continues to lag behind the U.S., China, and Europe in the number of international AI-related research papers and in the ratio of AI adoption in companies.\n\nIn addition, the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) of Switzerland released its global digital competitiveness ranking last September, ranking Japan 29th out of 63 countries surveyed. Japan ranked last in such areas as  \"data  utilization,\"  and  in  many  other  indicators  related  to  industry,  Japan remained in a low position. Experts are concerned that Japan may not be making investments commensurate with its national capacity.\n\nMeanwhile, large-scale investments in AI are accelerating around the world. In particular, the scale of computational resources and data used in AI, such as large language models like GPT, has a greater impact on performance than AI models based on conventional development methods. It is highly likely that those with huge investment resources such as funds, data, and human capital will become more and more powerful. Governments are moving quickly amid an increasingly competitive environment. In January this year, the U.S. announced a policy of investing US$2.6 billion (approx. 340 billion yen) in the development of a platform that will provide AI computing resources and data. In March this year, the U.K. announced that it would invest 900 million pounds (approx. 145 billion yen) in the development and maintenance of next-generation supercomputers, with a view to  developing  a  British  version  of  a  large-scale  language  model.  The  Indian government also announced the establishment of three AI research centers and the construction of the world's largest data set.\n\nIn  Japan,  the  government's  Council  for  the  Promotion  of  Comprehensive Innovation Strategy formulated the \"AI Strategy 2019\" in 2019, and packaged a wide  range  of  policies,  including  human  resource  development,  research  and\n\ndevelopment, social implementation in each field, and venture support,  into a national strategy to realize an \"AI-ready society.' Since then, the overall picture and  process  management  of AI-related  policy  initiatives  have  been  updated annually until \"AI Strategy 2022,\" which has been the driving force for promoting and monitoring policy. However, there are currently no plans to develop a new \"AI Strategy 2023,\" and this year the government intends to present the progress of its AI-related policy efforts in one of the chapters of the \"Integrated Innovation Strategy\" to be compiled by the Cabinet Office.\n\nIt is not easy to accurately predict the future of advanced technologies, which evolve continuously. Nevertheless, unless the government clarifies its objectives, goals, and commitments appropriate to the new technological environment and invests national resources flexibly and strategically with the understanding and cooperation of various stakeholders, it will be left behind at a crucial turning point. The potential of these increasingly sophisticated AI technologies must be linked to Japan's growth and solutions to social issues.\n\nBased on the above, we make the following recommendations.\n\n| 〇                                                                                   | In light of the rapid progress in the evolution and social implementation of         |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| large-scale language models and other foundationl model AIs, a new national          | large-scale language models and other foundationl model AIs, a new national          |\n| strategy  appropriate  for  the  New AI  Era  should  be  formulated  based  on  the | strategy  appropriate  for  the  New AI  Era  should  be  formulated  based  on  the |\n| various  recommendations  in  this  white  paper,  and  new  policies  should  be    | various  recommendations  in  this  white  paper,  and  new  policies  should  be    |\n| 〇  The new national strategy must plan for content and scale that will give         |                                                                                      |\n| Japan an international competitive advantage.

In preparing this document, a total of seven hearings were held with leading experts in the field of AI (Exhibit 1) to gather information for the appropriate design of measures required in the new era of AI. In addition, a working group (Exhibit 2) consisting of outside experts, such as lawyers with a high  level  of  expertise  in  the  field  of  AI,  provided  significant  assistance  in organizing and writing the recommendations.\n\n## 2. Develop and strengthen Japan's AI development capacity\n\n(1)  Building  and  strengthening  AI  model  development  capabilities,  including foundation models\n\nAs the social influence of AI is rapidly increasing, Japan needs to redefine its policy  goals  and  approaches  for  research  and  development  of  AI  models, including foundation models.\n\nFirst of all, Japan should accelerate various applied research and development using  foundation AI  models  in  Japan,  either  by  building  on  the  foundation AI models from overseas that are ahead of Japan, or by forming partnerships. In the process of actively developing and deploying products and services, domestic businesses  and  researchers  can  be  expected  to  accumulate  knowledge efficiently and quickly on advanced technologies. New  use cases and applications could be developed by taking advantage of Japan's strengths, and these could then be deployed overseas. If Japanese companies and researchers can  get  involved  in  related  communities  of AI  model  development  overseas, rather  than  remaining  mere  users,  it  will  also  contribute  to  human  resource development.\n\nOn the other hand, many experts interviewed both inside and outside the PT are in agreement that it will not be easy to develop, at least in the short term, a competitive and unique foundation model solely with domestic resources, given the current situation in which research and development of foundation models by overseas entities are far ahead of the Japanese competition. However, in light of the fact that the applications and social influence of AI using foundation models are  likely  to  keep  growing,  it  is  extremely  important  to  continue  to  build  and strengthen  Japan's  basic  technology  development  capabilities  for  foundation models, in addition to applied research. From the viewpoint of fostering young researchers  and  engineers,  it  is  also  necessary  to  continue  to  invest  in  and support basic research on a wide range of foundation AI models.\n\nIn addition, Japan has technological advantages in research and development of  AI  models  other  than  the  foundation  model  in  many  fields.  For  example, Japanese  companies  have  competitive  technologies  in  the  field  of  image recognition, such as facial recognition and object identification. In these fields, it is important to continue to create an environment in which Japan can take the initiative in international development, and there is an urgent need to develop AI human resources who can play an active role on the international stage.\n\nBased on the above, we make the following recommendations.\n\n- 〇 Accelerate applied research and development by accumulating domestic knowledge on foundation models through active use of overseas platforms.\n- 〇 In parallel, continue to invest in and support the building and strengthening of basic technology development capabilities, including foundation models, in Japan.\n- 〇 With regard to digital human resource development, measures for human resource development based on the AI Strategy 2022 should be steadily promoted, and further enhancement of human resource-related measures should be considered to develop internationally competitive  human resources,  focusing  not  only  on  the  development  phase  in  the  era  of foundation models, but also on the utilization phase.\n- 〇 Establish an \"AI hub\" that collects information on AI and serves as a point of  contact  between  companies  facing  challenges  and  with  excellent technical backgrounds and research personnel, and support the formation of a community.\n\n## (2) Accumulation and coordination of data resources\n\nIn order for AI to demonstrate superior performance, it needs to learn from a\n\nsufficient  quantity  and  quality  of  data.  However,  as  the  above-mentioned  IMD ranking  shows,  in  Japan,  data  resources  such  as  government  statistical  data have not been accumulated, and the utilization of data is completely insufficient. Even in areas where Japan has inherent international strengths, such as highquality medical data accumulated under the universal health insurance system, the data cannot be fully utilized because of the lack of coordination due to the lack of unified formats among different systems.\n\nAn important issue that has emerged in recent years in relation to foundational model AI is cultural and regional disparities (biases) due to biases in the data used for training. For example, there have been reports that users of an overseas image generation AI service have been unable to generate an accurate or useful picture of Japan due to insufficiently trained data on Japan, such as Japanese visual materials and cultural backgrounds. If AI performance becomes inferior in processing related to Japan internationally, this could have a direct impact on Japan's economic competitiveness. This situation needs to be corrected as soon as possible.\n\nBased on the above, we make the following recommendations.\n\n- In the next review of the \"Comprehensive Data Strategy\" scheduled for this year, government should work to create an environment that promotes the use of public and private sector data through AI. In doing so, further promote the  development  of  a  standard  data  model  and  clarify  the  attributes  and structure of the data.\n- Promote archiving public data held by the government  and local governments  so  that  the  data  can  be  utilized  in  the  foundation  model. Organize the rules and format for providing the data to third parties.\n- 〇 In  order  to  address  the  issue  of  data  bias,  government  should  work  to increase  the  ratio  of  Japan-related  training  data  by  actively  providing appropriate Japanese-language data for both domestic and foreign\n\nfoundation models. In addition, the government should take the initiative in promoting the creation  and utilization  of  a  Japanese  corpus  (a  structured database of Japanese sentences for bilingual translation).\n\n- 〇 Government should work to promote the development and practical use of source code generation AIs, enhancing and utilizing training data with with the goal of improving the efficiency of software development operations and addressing the shortage of digital human resources.\n\n## (3) Enhancement and utilization of computational resources\n\nFoundation models such as large-scale language models are the source for creating  high-performance  AI  products  and  services,  but  their  construction requires enormous  computing power.  The demand  for high-performance semiconductors is also expected to increase as the use of such models expands. In  particular,  according  to  recent  research,  the  performance  of  the  underlying model is known to dramatically improve when it is equipped with huge computing power of 1022 to 1024 in terms of training floating point operations per second (FLOPS).  However,  the  number  of  entities  that  can  provide  computational resources  of  this  scale  is  extremely  limited.  In  addition,  although  it  varies depending on the scale, it is not uncommon for a single training session to take several months or longer, and the construction of a superior infrastructure model requires an iterative learning cycle through repeated trial and error.\n\nConsidering the characteristics of such foundation models, it is not easy for companies and research institutes in Japan to secure the necessary computational resources and costs on their own, especially since they are so large. On the other hand, there is a strong need for these organizations to access huge  computational  resources  on  a  trial  basis  for  a  certain  period  of  time  to explore the possibility of utilizing the  foundation model in AI research and the development of new products and services. It is critical for the government to support the development and expansion of domestic computational resources as\n\npart of the social infrastructure to support future innovation and economic growth, utilizing the resources of national research institutes and other organizations.\n\nBased on the above, we make the following recommendations.\n\n- 〇 Referencing the \"AI  bridging  cloud\"  initiative  of  the  National  Institute  of Advanced  Industrial  Science  and  Technology  (AIST),  government  should promote the domestic infrastructure and expansion of the vast computing resources required to build and utilize the foundation models, and support the development of a new framework that can be shared and utilized by all related public and private entities.\n- Strengthen the development of the semiconductor industry with the goal of securing stable computing resources related to AI, taking into account the possibility  of  further  utilization  of  edge  computing  and  other  factors.  In particular, support should be strengthened for design capabilities and R&amp;D for high-performance semiconductors, etc., for which demand is expected to increase rapidly.\n\n## 3. Promotion of active AI utilization in public service\n\n## (1) Active use of AI by the government\n\nIn Europe, the United States, and other countries, governments themselves are major sources of data, and various types of AI, such as machine learning and automated  inference,  are  being  introduced  in  government  agencies. The  use cases  are  wide-ranging,  and  given  how  the  introduction  of  AI  in  Japan's administrative agencies is still in its infancy, there are many suggestions that can be used as a reference (see Exhibit 3).\n\nThe thorough utilization of AI in the field of public administration could bring immeasurable social benefits in terms of improving the quality and efficiency of administrative  services,  enabling  the  provision  of  more  individually  optimized administrative services and more precise measurement of policy effectiveness, thereby expanding the potential for full-scale evidence-based policy making. In addition, as Japan faces a shortage of workers due to a shrinking population and a severe fiscal situation, there is an ever-increasing need to use AI to eliminate waste and make human work as efficient as possible.\n\nThe government's initiative in taking on the challenge of utilizing a wide range of AI applications will also encourage local governments and private companies to  take  risks  and  engage  in  new  AI  projects.  In  particular,  there  are  many situations where AI can be utilized in internal administrative work and services for the public. It is expected that the government, as a launch customer for new AI applications  based  on  foundation  models,  will  foster  momentum  beyond  the boundaries of the public and private sectors and demonstrate its presence as a player in the new AI ecosystem.\n\nBased on the above, we make the following recommendations.\n\n- 〇 Investigate advanced AI applications in government organizations in other countries and guidelines for such applications, in order to inform the planning and implementation of AI introduction in Japan.\n\n- 〇 Immediately  initiate  multiple  pilot  projects  with  visible  results  in  a  short period  of  time  as  specific  examples  of  utilizing AI  for  basic  administrative services.\n\n## (Examples)\n\n-   Drafting of parliamentary answers, assistance in legislative affairs, support for  analysis  of  government  statistics,  and  preparation of meeting  minutes, etc.,  while  ensuring  consistency  with  documents  and  other  materials accumulated to date.\n\n-      Checking for incompleteness of application documents and responding to inquiries from the public regarding regulations and systems.\n\n- 〇 Hold a hackathon and business contest to discover projects for the use of AI in government.\n\n- Develop guidelines to further accelerate the thorough utilization of various types of AI, including foundational models, in government.\n\n- Establish  a  specialized  team  (AI  introduction  support  team)  within  the government to accumulate, analyze, and share use cases utilizing AI, and to support AI introduction, etc. in relevant organizations.\n\n## (2) Support for promotion of \"AI Smart Cities\" utilizing National Strategic Special Zones\n\nThe benefits of evolving AI can make a significant contribution to improving the quality of life of citizens and the efficiency of urban activities in local governments. Serious exploration of the possibilities of AI implementation through collaboration among  government,  private  businesses,  and  citizens,  not  only  in  municipal administrative services but also in all aspects of civic life, including transportation, medical and nursing care, agriculture,  power generation, and finance,  can  be\n\nhighly effective in local cities, which are facing financial difficulties and declining populations. In addition, the use of the special zone system, which allows policy benefits  through  various  deregulations,  should  be  encouraged as a promising option in promoting such AI smart city concepts.\n\nThe current  super  city-type  national  strategic  special  zones  are  required  to provide advanced services in \"approximately five or more fields.\" However, AI smart cities in the new era are expected to specialize in one or two fields, and it is desirable to be able to actively support proposals that demonstrate significant social benefits through the use of AI, even in a small number of fields. In addition, the  requirement  that  regulations  to  be  reformed  be  listed  in  advance  of  the application  for  a  special  zone  should  be  made  more  flexible  in  light  of  the constantly evolving nature of AI services.\n\nBased on the above, we make the following recommendations.\n\n〇 The  government  should  provide  strong  support  for AI-based  smart  city initiatives by local governments. In addition, from the perspective of making the current system and operation of super city-type national strategic special zones and digital rural special zones more suitable for AI utilization, check whether there are any points that need to be improved, and if so, improve them as soon as possible.\n\n## 4. Policies to encourage and support the use of AIs in the private sector\n\nRecent studies have shown that the degree of impact from the widespread use of AI in  large-scale  language models will vary  greatly by occupation: in occupations with a high degree of overlap between AI and skills, while work will become more efficient, there is likely to be a certain amount of labor migration. The time has come for all businesses to seriously rethink the impact of the new era of AI on their business.\n\nHowever, as mentioned above, the use of AI in the private sector in Japan lags far behind that of other countries. In particular, many small and mediumsized  enterprises  (SMEs)  have  yet  to  fully  adopt  AI  compared  with  their counterparts in other countries due to cost and lack of human resources. As foreign businesses work to transform their operations to adapt to the new AI environment, leaving this situation unchecked could be a major constraint on Japan's economic competitiveness.\n\nOn the other hand, the arrival of the new era of AI, which is expected to bring about significant changes in a wide range of areas from economic structure to social  structure,  is  an  excellent  opportunity  to  develop  new  products  and services, a chance to improve business profitability by utilizing AI, and to see the  emergence  of  many  next-generation  businesses  that  were  previously unthinkable.  It  is  important  to  inspire  young  human  resources  with  flexible thinking through a change in management awareness, and to draw out their abilities and potential through reskilling, which will lead to industrial development and enhanced competitiveness.\n\nTo this end, the government should alleviate management's concerns about the use of AI and promote the development of a safe and secure environment for  its  use.  Discussions  on AI  governance in companies and optimization of data  use  and  management  should  be  deepened  to  encourage  and  support companies' efforts to make use of AI.\n\nBased on the above, we make the following recommendations.\n\n- 〇 Immediately  conduct  a  study  on  the  impact  of  foundation  model AI  on various domestic industries.\n- 〇 Encourage the creation of various start-ups and new businesses that utilize AI. Promote and support accelerated migration of IT systems to the cloud, which is a prerequisite for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular to reap the benefits of AI utilization, such as improved productivity.\n- Private  businesses  and  public  institutions  above  a  certain  size  should establish a Chief Digital Officer (CDO) who is responsible for AI utilization and data handling.\n- 〇 Deepen discussions on how AI governance should be implemented  not only to manage risks for private operators, but also to encourage ingenuity and innovation; and if necessary, establish guidelines.\n- 〇 To  support  companies'  efforts  to  utilize  and  treat AI  human  resources, including reskilling, in order to develop human resources compatible with the new era of AI.\n\n## 5. New approaches to AI regulation\n\n## (1) Consideration of regulations for serious risk areas\n\nAs previously mentioned, both the EU and the US have been considering specific regulations for several serious risk areas, such as human rights violations and national security, since around 2019. With the evolution of AI foundational models such as large language models (LLMs) having a significant societal impact, it is expected that the risk of social harm through misuse will increase even more, and the discussions about regulation are expected to accelerate further. When roughly classifying the risk areas where legal discussions are progressing overseas, the following three types are mainly cited:\n\n## ・ \"Risks that violate human rights, health, and safety\"\n\nRisks of AI being used for crime, risks of exploiting vulnerabilities such as children and disabled persons, risks of AI being used for citizen surveillance like authoritarian states, risks of privacy violations, and so on.\n\n## ・ \"National Security Risks of AI\"\n\nRisks of military use of AI, risks of cyber attacks, risks of data and technology leakage overseas, risks of disinformation threatening national security through information manipulation, risks of the influx of AI products with espionage capabilities into domestic markets, and so on.\n\n## ・ \"Risks of undue intervention in the democratic process\"\n\nRisks of foreign forces using AI technology to interfere with elections, risks of inciting  public  opinion in  the  wrong  direction  by  spreading false  information\n\nabout topics such as historical recognition and culture, risks of distorting people's behavior through deep fakes disguised as politicians or government officials, risks of AI-generated mass comments on bills, and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, in Japan, since the Council for Promoting the Integrated Innovation in 2019 established the \"Principles for a Human-Centered AI Society,\" governance construction focusing on soft law such as guidelines has been advanced. There has been no consideration of hard law regulations focusing on AI in general, and the situation has continued wherein individual responses are decided according to regulations for each field such as medical care and transportation.\n\nHowever, considering that AI products and services to be introduced in the future  will  increasingly  be  utilized  across  borders,  that  the  current  foundation models primarily come from European and American platforms, and that national security risks such as military use of AI are increasing, the risk of Japan choosing an entirely different regulatory framework from Europe and the US will likely outweigh the benefits in the near future.\n\nBased on the above, we recommend the following.\n\n| 〇  countries, and conduct specific studies on areas where measures, including  laws and regulations, are considered necessary in the new era of AI, such as  (1)  serious  human rights violations, (2) national security, and (3) unjustified   | Analyze the status of AI regulations in the EU, the U.S., China, and other   |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 〇  To  actively  and  strategically  participate  in  discussions  on  the  use  of  AI  in  cooperation  with  other  countries,  taking  advantage of  various  opportunities  for  international  consultations,  including                   | international  rule-making                                                   |\n\n## (2) Agile regulatory adaptation to the new era of AI\n\nIn  Japan,  there  have  been  \"analog  regulations\"  that  require  written,  visual, stationed,  and  on-site  participation  as  factors  that  inhibit  the  use  of  digital technologies including  AI.  The  Digital  Agency is currently working  on  a comprehensive  review  of  these  analog  regulations,  and  is  in  the  process  of revising  all  the  laws  and  regulations  at  once.  The  review  of  these  analog regulations is expected to lead to the creation of new growth industries through a virtuous cycle of further development of AI technology through AI-based image recognition and diagnosis, big data analysis, etc., which in turn will lead to further regulatory review.\n\nIn  addition,  the  so-called  \"gray  zone  elimination  system\"  and  the  regulatory sandbox system have been introduced as current deregulation procedures, and have been utilized to a certain extent. However, especially when developing new businesses that use AI, there are often conflicts with vested interests, and various barriers, such as political friction, stand in the way of seeking deregulation. Unless Japan's various barriers of current regulations are removed, Japan's competitiveness will ultimately only decline as new services are created one after another in other countries. The speed and usability of these current deregulation procedures must be further improved to keep pace with the rapid rate of progress in AI technology.\n\nWhile updating laws and regulations is extremely important, there is a limit to how much can be fully addressed by hard law alone in a field like AI, given its rapid pace of progress. Therefore, methods such as the formulation of guidelines and  standards  should  be  combined  to  ensure  timely  and  flexible  updates  in response to technological evolution and expansion of applications. In addition, discussions  on  the  interpretation  of  intellectual  property  laws,  particularly  with regard to generative AI, are also attracting attention. Although this is a different issue from government regulatory requirements, it is worth considering the active use of guidelines, etc., to promote the progress of AI technology while preventing\n\nits abusive use, and further develop the content industry, which is one of Japan's strengths.\n\nBased on the above, we make the following recommendations.\n\n- Establish a mechanism to further promote the review of analog regulations based on digital principles by horizontally disseminating information obtained through technical verification of the potential use of AI to various ministries and the private sector.\n- Improve the speed and usability of current deregulation procedures, such as the Regulatory Reform Conference, sandboxes, and gray zone elimination system, to create and develop an environment in which businesses can take on new business challenges without being constrained by existing regulations.\n- Regarding the discussions over the interpretation of intellectual property laws  in  relation  to  generative AI,  consider  establishing  guidelines,  etc.,  to promote the progress of AI technology while preventing its abusive use, and further develop the content industry, which is one of Japan's strengths.\n\n## (3) Organize guidelines for AI utilization in education\n\nIn the past, the widespread use of the Internet, search services, etc. had an impact  on  school  education,  but  the  impact  of  foundation  model AIs  such  as ChatGPT will have an even greater impact. The Internet and other services have given students easy access to a vast amount and variety of information, and have diversified the methods of learning. AI with large-scale language models will have a more advanced function in this respect, and this will have the positive effect of further diversifying learning methods. On the other hand, however, the ease with which students can use AI to complete tasks such as writing essays in a flash may undermine their motivation to learn.\n\nIn other countries, there have been various moves to ban the use of large-scale language models in elementary schools, but Japan's educational administration has yet to establish a set policy for the handling of such AI. It is also anticipated that curricula content will need to be adapted to take into account the progress of AI.\n\nBased on the above, we make the following recommendations.\n\n| 〇                                                                                                                          | Specifically position the improvement of AI literacy in the public education  curriculum in anticipation of the AI native era, when active use of AI in daily  socioeconomic activities will be the norm.   |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 〇                                                                                                                          | With the above in mind, guidelines for the handling of AI, including whether                                                                                                                                |\n| or  not  students  can use  large-scale  language  models  in public  education,  should be formulated as soon as possible. | or  not  students  can use  large-scale  language  models  in public  education,  should be formulated as soon as possible.                                                                                 |\n\nEnd\n\n## AI Project Team Schedule\n\n| Date   | Theme                                        | Lecturer                                                                                                                           |\n|--------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Feb 3  | AI Policies in Japan and other  nations      | ・ Cabinet Office  ・ Digital Agency  ・ Hiroyuki Sanbe (Attorney, Atsumi & Sakai)                                                 |\n| Feb 17 | Japans strategy in a new AI era              | ・ Yutaka Matsuo (Professor, Tokyo University)  ・ Kazuto Ataka (Professor, Keio University)                                       |\n| Feb 22 | Regulation in a new AI era                   | ・ AI Contract Review Technology Association  ・ Digital Agency                                                                    |\n| Mar 3  | The evolution of AI and its  challenges      | ・ Joichi Ito (Director, Chiba Institute of  Technology, Center for Radical  Transformation)                                       |\n| Mar 3  | AI risk and governance                       | ・ Kojin Oshiba (Co-Founder, Robust  Intelligence)                                                                                 |\n| Mar 14 | Data and computing resource in a  new AI era | ・ Hiroaki  Kitano  (Presiden  and  CEO,  Sony  Computer Science Laboratories, Inc.)  ・ Tohru Nishikawa (CEO, Preferred Networks) |\n| Mar 17 | ChatGPT and Microsoft                        | ・ Japan Microsoft                                                                                                                 |\n| Mar 17 | Personal AI                                  | ・ Koichi Hashida (Professor, Tokyo University)                                                                                    |\n| Mar 23 | Global trends in a new AI era                | ・ Ren Ito (COO, Stability AI)                                                                                                     |\n\n## Exhibit １\n\n## AI Project Team Working Group Members\n\n| Name            | Organization                           |\n|-----------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Hiroyuki Sanbe  | Attorney, Atsumi & Sakai               |\n| Jun Okada       | Attorney, Mori Hamada & Matsumoto      |\n| Keiji Tonomura  | Attorney, Nagashima Ohno &  Tsunematsu |\n| Masaharu Koyano | Attorney, WG secretariat               |\n\n(United States)\n\n- Immigration: The U.S. Department of Homeland Security is experimenting with the use  of artificial intelligence in immigration  screening.
